# FriendlyGate

FriendlyGate is a discord bot that grants users roles based on their [Friend Tech](https://www.friend.tech/) key holdings.
It uses the X account connected to the discord account to fetch the user's key holdings.

Right now it's deprecated, but it was used by a couple discord groups back in Q3/Q4 of 2023.
